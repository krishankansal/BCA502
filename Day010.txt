When ever the object(Instance) is created, it gets
its own set of properties.

Suppose we have 10 properties defined in class
and we have created 100 objects of class.
a,b,c,d......100

1000

For this we use constructors.

lass Box{
        int height;
        int width;
        int depth;
        
public static void main(String args[]){
        Box myBox = new Box();
        Box mySecondBox = new Box();

        myBox.height = 10;
        myBox.width = 10;
        myBox.depth = 10;

        mySecondBox.height = 20;
        mySecondBox.width = 20;
        mySecondBox.depth = 20;

        System.out.println("Volume of myBox = " + (myBox.height * myBox.width * myBox.depth));
        System.out.println("Volume of mySecondBox = " + (mySecondBox.height * mySecondBox.width * mySecondBo>

}
}




Constructors
-------------
Constructors are object initializers.
Constructors are used to initialize the object.
Constructors are just like methods with no return type.
The name of the constructors should exactly same as that of class.


lass Box1{
        int height;
        int width;
        int depth;

        Box1(int x,int y, int z){
        this.height = x;
        this.width = y;
        this.depth = z;
        }       

        public static void main(String args[]){
        Box1 b = new Box1(10,10,10);
        Box1 b1 = new Box1(20,20,20);
         System.out.println("Volume of b = " + (b.height * b.width * b.depth));
        System.out.println("Volume of b1 = " + (b1.height * b1.width * b1.depth));
        }

}
