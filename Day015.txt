In Java language there is no concept of global variables.

There are three types of variables in Java Language
1. Instance Variables
	- variables that are declared with in class are known as
	  instance variables.
	  
Examples:
	class MyClass{
		float salary;
		String name;
		int age;
		static String companyName = "TCS";	
	}
A, B, C, D	  
	
	  
2. Local Variables
	- The variables that are declared within the method are known as local
	  variables.
	
	void sum(int a, int b){
		int x = a + b;	
	}
	
	- These variables are called local variables since there scope is local.	
	

3. Class Variables
	- static variables are known as class variables.




class CountObject{
	int count = 0;
	
	CountObject(){
		count = count + 1;
		System.out.println("Total Number Of Objects = " + count);
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		CountObject a = new CountObject();
		CountObject b = new CountObject();
		CountObject c = new CountObject();
		CountObject d = new CountObject();
	}
	
}

class CountObjects{
	static int count = 0;
	
	CountObjects(){
		count = count + 1;
		System.out.println("Total Number Of Objects = " + count);
	}
	
	public static void main(String args[]){
		CountObjects a = new CountObjects();
		CountObjects b = new CountObjects();
		CountObjects c = new CountObjects();
		CountObjects d = new CountObjects();
	}	
}

class Student{
	int rollno;
	String name;
	static collegeName = "IAMR";
